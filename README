Notes from consultation:
Roads - comprehensive network of transport:
-allows people/things to move within the estate over shorter distance and shorter time at ease 
-allows people/things to move in and out of the estate
Because things are so connected, people walk around more and leave vehicles
-> less vehicles on roads -> less carbon footprint

Government subsidises a lot for buying of flats 

lesser use of fossil fuels -> lesser carbon footprint
