            <p class="headers">What are some factors affecting the land dedicated for housing?</p><br>
            <p class="list-numbers">1. Limited Land Supply:</p>
            <p>The suitable land for housing is limited due to presence of physical features like seas and mountains. The small land areas found in cities only adds on to the issue of limtied land supply.</p><br>

            <p class="list-numbers">2. Competition for Land Use:</p>
            <p> There are many uses for land like residential, commercial, industrial and recreational uses as well as for infrastructures. This results in stiff competition for land use and insufficient land being set aside for housing. Additionally, land dedicated for one use will not  be available for another use.</p><br>

            <p class="list-numbers">3. Different Perspectives:</p>
            <p>Conflict of interests arise between various groups of people as there are different economic, social and environmental needs</p><br>

            <p>These stakeholders come together to decide on the development of cities and manage different activites sustainably</p>
