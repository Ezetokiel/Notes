            <p class="headers">What is a green building?</p>
            <p>It's an integrated process that focuses on the relationship between the built-in environement and the natural environment (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyIOtsx3wDs&t=67s" target="_blank" class="links">Green building video</a>)</p>
            <p>- reduced energy and water use</p>
            <p>- healthy indoor environmental quality</p>
            <p>- smart material selection</p><br>

            <p class="list-numbers">*Case study: <a href="https://www.mynicehome.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/RS-UbiGrovePrecinctPanel.pdf" target="_blank" class="links">HDB Grove Precinct</a>*</p><br>

            <div class="containers">
                <p class="headers">*What environmental features are there?</p>
                <p class="list-numbers">1. Energy Efficient Lighting</p>
                <p>- Energy-efficient lighting uses special bulbs that use less electricity to produce light.</p>
                <p>- It reduces electricity use for lighting, which saves energy and lowers electricity bills.</p>
                <p>- It's good for the environment because it reduces the demand for electricity from power plants, which can be polluting.</p><br>

                <p class="list-numbers">2. Double Glazed Windows</p>
                <p>- Double-glazed windows have two layers of glass with a gap in between.</p>
                <p>- They keep the heat out in hot weather</p>
                <p>- They help save energy by reducing the need for air conditioning, making homes more comfortable and eco-friendly.</p><br>

                <p class="list-numbers">3. Solar Panels</p>
                <p>- big, flat, shiny panels that turn sunlight into electricity</p>
                <p>- provide clean energy for homes, reducing the need to use fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution</p>
                <p>- help fight climate change, and save money on electricity bills</p>
                <p>Case study: Pilot Solar-Ready Roof completed at Punggol Edge, Singapore</p><br>

                <p class="list-numbers">4. Green Roofs</p>
                <p>- Green roofs are special roofs covered with plants and grass</p>
                <p>- they keep buildings cooler, reduce energy use, and make cities greener</p>
                <p>- Green roofs save energy, look nice, and help the environment</p>
                <p>Case study: Block 756A Bedok Resovior View, Singapore</p><br>

                <p class="list-numbers">5. Rainwater Harvesting</p>
                <p>- rainwater is collected from roofs stored and is used for things like watering plants and flushing toilets</p>
                <p>- saves tap water, which is important becuase Singapore has limited natural water resources (reduces reliance on imported water</p>
                <p>- rainwater harvesting helps save water and is good for the environment</p><br>

                <p>Always link back environmental features to the alternative use of energy -> less fossil fuels being used -> lesser carbon footprint</p>
